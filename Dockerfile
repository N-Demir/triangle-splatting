###### How to edit this file ######
# Docker and Dockerfiles are quite simple:
# - a dockerfile is the set of instructions for getting a fresh machine ready to run your code
# - start by defining a base image (FROM ...) based on the cuda and torch version you want. This gets the hard gpu driver stuff out of the way
# - set env vars with ENV ..., change directories with WORKDIR ..., and run commands with RUN ...
# - avoid using conda installs (just replace them with pip installs) because getting conda initialized in docker is a pain
# 
# Beam will handle building the docker image from this file, but you can also build it yourself and run it wherever you want

###### Method Installation ######
# Probably easiest to pull the repo from github, but you can also copy files from your local machine with COPY 
# eg: COPY . .
RUN git clone https://github.com/N-Demir/triangle-splatting.git . --recursive

# Install (avoid conda installs because they don't work well in dockerfile situations)
# Separating these on separate lines helps if there are errors (previous lines will be cached) especially on the large package installs
# eg:
RUN pip install torchvision==0.19.1
RUN pip install tqdm
RUN pip install plyfile
RUN pip install open3d
RUN pip install lpips
RUN pip install mediapy
RUN pip install opencv-python
RUN bash compile.sh
RUN cd submodules/simple-knn && pip install .

# Note: If your install needs access to a gpu it's actually possible to do that through Beam's python sdk. Check their docs or reach out!
